summary: My job for the past year as a ResNet support specialist for UH Manoa Student Housing.
---
For the past year I have been working for Student Housing Services at UH Manoa where I have gained valuable life skills at a professional level IT position. I learned basic networking for two years in high school while going through Cisco's own CCNA 1 and CCNA 2 courses. I learned the in-and-outs of networking and how to use Cisco or other networking products to create either a simple or complex network. While at my current position I have learned how to be a professional and effective IT specialist. I have helped countless students with their technological woes and installed access points for WiFi in a residence hall that we did not previously service WiFi to. I have fixed everything from switches to basic student routers. The next thing on my list to learn is databases, javascript, PHP, HTML, and perhaps basic PCB board repair. I have recently been tasked with heading a project where we plan to install digital signs in the four freshmen residence halls.
