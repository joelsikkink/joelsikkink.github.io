  I've been told that ever since I was little I've been fascinated with computers and all that encompasses them. I have been using computers and the internet pretty much non-stop since then. I've grown up in the perfect era to see the rise of powerful handheld  and portable devices while completely dodging the old punch card ways of coding. In my K-12 education I took as many chances as I could and made the most of the time that I was given for technology. I purposely took as many computer based courses as I could ranging from networking to A+ certification. 

  My fascination however didn't stop at school, I was always on the computer when I has the chance in elementary and in middle school I bought a laptop for myself. I built my own computer once I had the funds from working my senior year and have been upgrading it since. I played tons of games and coded basic stuff in my off-time. I read a java book in sophmore year knowing I would only be able to take computer science in my senior year but I wanted to try early and get ahead. I didn't really start to flourish on the software end of things until that computer science class but even then there is only so much that is taught at the high school level. I wanted to learn more...

I'm excited to finally take a software engineering class where now I can make use of all of the basics that I have learned for the past two years. I am ready to finally learn javascript, html, and php. I've wanted to make webpages for a while but have always been held back to the restraints of some companies like wordpress. The skills I will learn here will also help me create web applications for work. I can already name one off the top of my head that I'm sure my boss would love for me to make. I'm ready to finally start moving ahead, really start to apply all of what I have learned, and create some awesome applications.
