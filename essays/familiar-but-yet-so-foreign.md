  Jumping into this class I didn’t expect there to be such a graceful transition between 211 and where I am now with 314. The familiarity between base Java and Javascript make this not even feel like a new class sometimes as opposed to my 212 course where I’m learning C and UNIX. The differences between all of the programming languages aren’t all too bad but the fact that moving over from Java to Javascript is as easy as remembering a few little things did catch me off guard. The little things do mess me up sometimes. For example, in the first WOD I got a DNF simply because of the fact that my mind didn’t flip the switch on a few key changes from Java and that resulted in me finishing moments after time was called. I tried to make my parameter for the function a strong variable by adding brackets. I also was having difficulty troubleshooting and debugging my code because I didn’t have and IDE to use as well as the fact that I couldn’t entirely tell what was wrong. I still don’t know how what I did was wrong but at this point I’ve accepted the fact that I need to get more practice so Javascript is more second nature. I find the WODS and the whole athletic environment stressful and I’m not sure how it will work out for me yet. I tend to not code right the first time rather often and that leads to me debugging for a bit. This may lead to me getting out of that habit but as stated earlier, not having an IDE makes my current strategy rather ineffective. I was pretty stressed during the first WOD and most of that hit me once I was getting a weird output and I couldn’t tell what was wrong. In order to adapt to this style of learning and teaching I will definitely have to make some drastic changes and practice coding right the first time as much as possible. I’d much rather prefer a different style but it is what it is and the only thing I can do now is improve myself and my performances
